# Galaxy Exploration with SDSS
Welcome to the 2024 Warrior Scholar Project STEM Bootcamp at MIT!

In this project, we will learn about galaxies using publicly available data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We will look at how we collect information about galaxies using optical telescopes and how we can use that information to figure out the properties of the galaxies. We will then use galaxy data to "weigh" a galaxy cluster, which will lead us to an interesting discovery about the universe!
